            <p>Forty kilometres away from Ranchi is the breath-taking Patratu Valley, with its lush greenery,
                mesmerising views and misty mountains. Visitors can see the Patratu Dam on one side and an expansive
                green belt on the other. Almost as beautiful as the valley is the drive to this picturesque destination,
                where one can catch glimpses of the sparkling water and winding roads. Another attraction is the Patratu
                dam that offers boating services from 9 am to 5 pm.</p>

            <p>Gangtok being an eminent Buddhist pilgrimage center in India as well as an ideal hill station for leisure travellers encircling some high altitude lakes and mountain passes is well connected by road to other mighty hill stations as well as nearby cities. Well the only possible way to reach Gangtok is by road from Bagdogra that is the closest airport, Siliguri that is the closest commercial hub and New Jalpaiguri that is the closest railway station. Nonetheless one planning a drive from Darjeeling to Gangtok, which is approximately 110kms, has to drive en route Jorethang, Manpur and Rangpo. The distance from Bagdogra Aiprort to Gangtok by road is approximately 125kms whereas from New Jalpaiguri to Gangtok is approximately 115kms. The distance from Siliguri to Gangtok is just 112kms whereas from Kalimpong it is only 74kms. One planning to drive from Pelling needs to cover a distance of 110kms whereas from Ravangla to Gangtok is just 70kms. Well how to reach Gangtok is not a matter of fuss as one will get cabs and buses that plies daily from Bagdogra, Siliguri and New Jalpaiguri. Well during the monsoon it is hard to get one still you need to bargain according to your budget.


                One planning to reach Gangtok by train has got limited access. The New Jalpaiguri Railway Station acts as the closest railway station that connects Gangtok by road within 3 hours to 4 hours. The New Jalpaiguri Railway Station is one of the important railway stations that connect the North Eastern state of India to rest of India.
                
                
                The Bagdogra Airport is the closest airport from Gangtok that connects to rest of India. Hence one planning to reach Gangtok by air has to book a flight to Bagdogra that runs schedules flights from Bangalore to Bagdogra and other major cities like Kolkata, New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Pune as well as flights from Ahmedabad to Bagdogra and from the airport needs to hire a cab to Gangtok.</p>
