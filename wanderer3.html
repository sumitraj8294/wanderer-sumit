            <p>Dhooska or Dhuska is a popular deep-fried snack eaten all over Jharkhand, India. The main ingredients in
                this savoury fried bread dish are powdered rice, powdered chana dal and sometimes boiled potatoes. The
                bread is then deep fried. It is often served with any sauce or chutney. Dhooska is mostly made in
                market-area stalls where people enjoy it as a snack and is rarely found in larger restaurants.</p>

            <p>Litti, also called baati sometimes, along with chokha, is a complete meal that originated from the
                Bhojpuri region of the Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.It is a dough ball made up of whole
                wheat flour and stuffed with gram flour, pulses and mixed with herbs and spices. It is baked over coal
                or wood and tossed with large amounts of ghee. Although very often confused with the closely related
                Rajasthani dish, baati, it is a completely different dish in terms of taste, texture and preparation. It
                may be eaten with curd, brinjal chokha, potato chokha, and papad.The litti are traditionally baked over
                a wood fire,but in the modern days, a new fried version has been developed.</p>
